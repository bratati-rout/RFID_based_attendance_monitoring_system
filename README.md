# RFID_based_attendance_monitoring_system
Final Year Project 

So, in our project, what we are trying to do is automate the legacy attendance monitoring process. And we are doing this with the help of RFID technologies and other necessary IoT tools and techniques. 
Instead of calling out names or handling a sheet of paper through the class, teachers/professors will be able to monitor attendance of a large volume of students in a matter of a few seconds. Every student and teacher have their own RFID integrated ID cards with them. Now, this is done by providing a “Student Unit” at every seating of the class unlike the model of RFID attendance monitoring system, which mounts their reader on the entry point. 
All Student Units are connected wirelessly to a single Master Control Unit. This Master Control Unit is used by the Teacher/Professor to initiate the attendance taking process.

Communication in large volume is carried between the Student unit and the Master Control Unit and also the MCU and the database.

One thing that our mentor pointed out at a later stage was the problem of false attendance. So, we had to include an authentication system in place to monitor such misconducts. Even though it is not 100% effective in achieving that, it is available for future analysis.
